That means they have been dating for about two years. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Further, they also reportedly got along very well despite their age difference. "The age gap doesn’t seem to be a problem, even though he is older than her father," the source added.</p><p>According to Page Six's report, Alfallah has a history of dating older men, which their insider source also conformed to. She has dated Mick Jagger (2017)&nbsp;and Nicolas Berggruen&nbsp;in the past and was also linked with Clint Eastwood. The latter, she claimed, was only a "family friend."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The couple met in Hollywood as she, too, is involved in show business, although in a small capacity. She has produced two short movies — Brosa Nostra in 2018 and La Petite Mort in 2019. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Al Pacino’s Dating History</h2><p>Pacino's dating history is a tale of multiple <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">short-term relationships</a> with women in show business. The tale starts with Jill Clayburgh. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Pacino and Clayburgh dated before he achieved the superstardom he has now. They lived in New York together and even helped each other with auditions.</p><p>They even reportedly planned on getting married and having kids, but after five years, Pacino called everything off and ended the relationship.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The next woman he dated was Tuesday Weld. This relationship only lasted a few months.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Then came Veruschka von Lehndorff, a German actress who was everyone's dream girlfriend at the time. Pacino could tie her down, but only for a little fling.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Pacino and <a href=# rel=follow>Diane Keaton</a>, his next girlfriend, met on the sets of Godfather. They did three Godfather movies together but only started dating after the third movie came out in 1990. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Their experience in Hollywood and mutual respect for their craft bonded them, though their bond only lasted three years. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Beverly D'Angelo was Pacino's next female partner. They met on a plane while flying between LA and New York.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>For once, Pacino looked to have a stable, serious relationship. The couple, after multiple tries at conceiving, gave birth to twins — Anton and Olivia — in 2001 through IVF.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>After their birth, however, things went south for the couple. By 2003, they grew bitter with one another and got into a custody battle they later had to settle privately in 2004.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>His longest relationship yet came next. In 2008, Pacino started dating Lucila Polak, and the two quickly started thinking about marriage and kids.</p><p>However, things with Polak ended similarly to how his first relationship finished. This time, it was Polak who was not ready for such long-term commitments. They reportedly broke up in 2019.</p><p>Meital Dohan is the Oscar-winning actor's most recent ex-girlfriend. They first started going out, presumably, right after things ended with Polak, but the timeline is a bit confusing. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Pacino and Dohan were together for approximately two years, but things ended because of the age gap they shared. According to her, even though he was a legendary actor, he was still an "<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">elderly man</a>."</p><p>"So even with all my love, it didn’t last," Dohan said&nbsp;in February 2020. Another thing she was upset about him was his unwillingness to spend money.</p><p>"How can I say politely that he didn’t like to spend money? … He only bought me flowers," she piled on. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Nevertheless, she was still grateful that they dated, and she wished they could remain good friends.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmcYr2ir8inpmafmae5p77InqWdZZGcsm6zwKlloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./cm-punk-says-aew-s-best-in-the-world-references-could-relate-to-daniel-bryan-i-hear-best-in-t.html>&#171;&nbsp;CM Punk says AEW's 'Best in the World' references could relate to Daniel Bryan: 'I hear Best In t</a>
