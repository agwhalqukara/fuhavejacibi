Keeping to her signature quirky pop sound, Belot expands her rhythm and groove by experimenting with her sound aesthetic which led to an addictive alternative melody that demanded she used it in a song – and that’s exactly what she did, creating this unforgettable track. “V.I.P” follows up her previous singles “<a href=#>Get This</a>” and “<a href=#>Cool Whip</a>“.</p><p>Belot, real name Maya Belot, is a North London-born singer-songwriter who is obsessed with pop music, so it’s not a surprise that she has followed her passion by rising up the pop music industry. At the age of 8, she started to learn to play the guitar and by the age of 12, she started using a laptop and recording her music, using Logic. Building up her career at a young age, she enrolled in the Brit School at 14 years old, which allowed her to grow as an artist and follow a direction leading to her iconic unique style of pop music that we hear from her now. She dropped her debut single “Familiar” in April 2020 – which is her most-streamed single on Spotify, to date, with 2.9 million streams – and after a few more singles, she dropped her debut EP “Electric Blue”, a few months later. Roll on a couple more years and she released her sophomore EP “Harmless Fun”, to critical acclaim. She started her 2023 era with a bang, due to the release of “<a href=#>Cool Whip</a>”; she continued to make an impact with her previous single “<a href=#>Get This</a>”; and now “V.I.P” is making its mark.</p><p>Written by Maya Belot and Stephen Barnes, whilst it has been produced by Max Margolis and Maya Belot, “V.I.P” is a strong pop number from this rising singer-songwriter playing hard with her quirky sound bringing awesome layered vocals, a full-out confident attitude, and gaming tectonic beats at the end. Impressive to say the least, whilst also making us speechless, Belot has gone all out for this one and we are absolutely addicted. Strong from the get-go, Belot’s vocals are on point, sending out self-empowerment lyrics full of confident energy which is passed on effortlessly to her listeners. With attitude and swag to the max, Belot turns her quirkiness to 11 and we are so here for it. With a chant-like chorus that will have you singing along with just as much style and strength as Belot, “V.I.P” is one of those tracks that is set to gain traction, standing out for all the right reasons on popular playlists. As the track ends, Belot experiments further with distorted vocalise and gaming-esque tectonic beats, making sure that we won’t forget this song.</p><p>Talking about this track, Belot said: “I can honestly say ‘V.I.P’ was a song I never expected to write. ‘V.I.P’ was a classic case of making the music before writing the lyrics. I have to make it clear that this song is totally conceptual at least for the moment – raindrops of Champagne are still very much their full and extortionate price. My co-writer and I had started playing around with this sort of groove, at first it started off being a bit of silliness, but we kept going and eventually, we were like… we HAVE to use this. It sort of had this nostalgic energy, we both grew up listening to Eminem, Dr Dre, 50 Cent etc. and we were all about it. (It goes without saying we have absolutely nothing on any of those artists but we can try.) We both sort of knew what a beat like this demanded from a song and so we went in, full force. This song is about glitz, glamour, success, and redemption. It just had to be. The story of becoming the biggest artist one could be.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Stream “V.I.P” by Belot on Spotify here:</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>“V.I.P”, by Belot, is available to download and stream, right now, across all platforms, via Submarine Cat Records.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Let us know what you make of “V.I.P” by Belot on Twitter <a href=#>@CelebMix</a>.</h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kr6a4zq1knaqfpcBuvdSiqaSxXZi8r6%2FEqauumZxivbC8jKygp5%2Bcmnq3echmp2adqKWur7DIp55moJWnerS1xqeYra2imnq0u9Snm2g%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./f-murray-abraham-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>&#171;&nbsp;F.
